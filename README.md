# ar_vr_memory_palace
create


The goal of the ar_vr_memory_palace application would be simple, it will work as tool for learning conceptual skills (languages) . I myself am dyslixic and need to see concepts in a physical space, ideally connected to somthing i'm already farmiler with for it to stick. In the past I'll learn the layout of diffrent spaces, become farmiler with them, and then place the concepts in those unique spaces in my minds eye. 

The concept is simple in concept, but maybe not to produce. I'd like to be able to upload 360 images, or record interesting places using 3D Mapping Tech that can be saved withen the app. Then withen the 360 photo, or recorded spaces, be able to add pins containing, text, photos, saved 3D imagees, really any media that will help you remember the thing you're trying to remember. 

Addtionally being able to save interesing locations to later revisit in AR would be a plus. content could be user donated at the start and then generated by our team later on. How do we scan/record the area content? what tech is used? lidar maybe? What does google use? Maybe for tests we can pull from their database of content. 

The "Key selling point" of this application would be the the unlimited 'unique locations' to learn in, and the "community insites and analogies", where other users share the tricks they've used to help learn and remeber odd topics. Users can even see the insights relevent to them based on the content they already consume... tracked by cookies, IG, views... this area would need more work. 

NO ADS IN THE LEARNING ENVIRMENT EVER!
WE WANT TO CREATE AN ENVIROMENT FOR LEARNING, A PLACE THAT TRULY ADDS VALUE TO THE USERS.
INCOME MUST COME FROM SOME OTHER SORCES... MAYBE SUBSCRIPTIONS, FOR NOW IT DOESN'T MATTER.
